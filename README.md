Distant computer control with binary and sql database - Proof of concept - For security purpose ONLY
Created for academic purpose.

##How does it work

When compiled create a binary file. Replace variables starting with YOUR_*** to make it work.
When executed it display a fake Window Error and hide in process.
It then checks your **mysql** database and search for command to execute every 5 seconds.
Exacutable commands are listed below.

##Commands currently usable :
- OuvrirPage() // Open a web page in the distant computer default browser
- EcranBleu() // Create a fake fullscreen error-like BSOD
- Bip() // Make the distant computer bip... Yep that's it

##WARNING

This piece of software should NEVER be used against someone's will.
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS.
